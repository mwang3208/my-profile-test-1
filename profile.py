### Teaching 5G with POWDER and OpenAirInterface5G

This profile is derived from a tutorial session created by Dustin Maas for MERIF 2023.
It deploys a single compute node with an image that includes docker,
docker-compose, tshark, oai-cn5g-fed v1.4.0, and docker images for all of the
OAI 5G core network functions. It also includes source code and a prebuilt
version of the OAI RAN stack (gNB, nrUE, RF simulator). It shows how
profiles like this one can be used in the classroom to explore 5G networks.

The description and instructions for the original MERIF session can be found
[here](https://gitlab.flux.utah.edu/powderrenewpublic/merif2023/-/blob/main/content/teaching-5g-oai.md).

tourInstructions = """

Note: After you instantiate an experiment, you have to wait until the POWDER
portal shows your experiment status in green as "Your experiment is ready"
before proceeding.
